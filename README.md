An End-to-End Computer Vision Task Using YOLO for People Detection in Mall Surveillance Videos
In the era of surveillance and large public gatherings, counting the number of people in real-time is crucial for crowd management, security monitoring, and analytics in public spaces such as malls, airports, or stadiums. Our aim is to take surveillance footage, detect people in each frame, and display a bounding box around each detected individual, along with the total count of people present in the frame. The primary technology behind this is a deep learning model known as YOLO (You Only Look Once), specifically YOLOv8, which is known for its real-time object detection capabilities. The processed output is a video with an overlay showing the number of people detected in each frame, making this project an end-to-end solution using computer vision.
